I want to build a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that we can expand to cover all the features we need over time. 

The first step is getting all of the major pieces set up, including:
- Git on Azure DevOps
- SQL Server Database
- WebAPI with authentication
- WPF application that can log into the API

GET THESE SET UP FIRST!

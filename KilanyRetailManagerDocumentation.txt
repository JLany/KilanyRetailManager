1- Database Tables: 
	- In table User:
	  The primary key (Id) is the actual Authentication Id for the user 
	  in AspNetUsers table generated by EFCore.

	- In table Sale: 
	  Total is a column and not derived, because it is going to be used
	  a lot in reporting. On the other hand, no Total column in table 
	  SaleDetail.

2- Depend on the API to determine the CashierId:
	Sepecifically,
	this is the responsiblity of the Client. It will 
	send the token currently stored in the frontend, and the API uses
	it to determine the Cashier.
	(This is essentially what is happening with every request after 
	logging in to the frontend application.)
	But what if there are multiple stores for some company?
	This works if we depend on the UI to send in the request the current 
	user's token, because not more than one user can be logged in at the
	same time from one frontend application. But they can from multiple 
	instances of a frontend application.

3- Do not depend on the frontend's calculated values, we calculate it in the 
   API instead.
